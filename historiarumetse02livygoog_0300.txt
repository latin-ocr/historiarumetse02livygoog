Livy has more puzzled commentatum thau this. ome regard rt escornupt,
tippugh ancient copies, both manuscript and printed, agree in the reading

Of those who consider tho text as seond, some think densa ls used ad·
verbially for densi (as in viruit, Georgics, ii. 275. Demi scre), audiqualifiea
obsita: nome make densa and obsito both agree with uirgulta, and interpret
ubeda by adsita, ad'ucentiu: and some write ob cita as two words, either
placin a comma aher circu, thus locis eir-cd, derna ob situ uirgadta obscuris,
or, witirout a comma, construing as if, oh circd donau sita uirgulta. 'ro those

of the above modes in which obsita is written as one word, it is objected,
that, in its usual sense ot ‘ set thick with,’ ‘overgrown or covered with ¹ it
always agrees with the thing covered, aud not with that which covers3 tlrua
· toea obsito idrgtdtic is a proper expressionum not so uirgadto obsita lucia:
while the inter retation of obsito hy omnemne is not warranted by a single
exam le. lt lias also been ohjocted that the construction, which occurs in
the a ve modes, of two adjectives before oue substantivae harsh aud
unusual ς but examples sufficient to ‘ustify this are found in Livy, as well aa
other authors, e. g. cirratis regin sellu, speciemve tuitionis dics, eto.

'I'hose who think the text eorru t are no less at varianco with each other
aa to tha manner os restoring it. ne reading proposed is locis carot denuo
obsito oiruvdto oberans, another, densi obsito triagnello, (both of which are open
to the objection mentioned above, of applyiuc obsito to the utrong ⁰b3l⁰⁶¹l3
another, partem militnm loeis circd denso obsitae itti-„noum obscuram. A oudlt
reforms the passage hy leaving out obsito, as a gloss (or explanatory word)
in the margin of the manuscript, which hy aeoirlent carne into the text3 while
a fifth, and the happiest emendation of all, is by Heinsius, locis circel demo
obsim trirgutltolnc abactoris.
